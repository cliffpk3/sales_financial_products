<h2>1 Business Problem:</h2>
The business problem at hand is to gain insights into the sales and profitability of financial products in different states and regions of Brazil. The primary objective is to identify which states and regions are the most profitable and which may be experiencing losses.

<h2>2 Business Assumptions:</h2>
To address this business problem, we'll work with the following assumptions:

<h4>2.1 The Southeast region is the most profitable in Brazil:</h4>
We assume that the Southeast region, which includes states such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais, is the most profitable in terms of financial product sales.

<h4>2.2 The Northeast region ranks second in profitability:</h4>
We assume that the Northeast region, which includes states like Bahia and Pernambuco, ranks second in terms of profitability.

<h4>2.3 The South region does not generate significant relative profits:</h4>
We assume that the South region, comprising states like Paraná and Santa Catarina, does not contribute significantly to overall profits.

<h2>3 Solution Strategy:</h2>
To address the business problem and validate our assumptions, we will implement the following solution strategy:

<h4>3.1 Data Collection and Preparation:</h4>
Gather data on sales and profit for financial products in each state and region.
Clean and preprocess the data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

<h4>3.2 Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation:</h4>
Create data visualizations, such as bar charts, heatmaps, and geographic maps, to display the sales and profit data for each state and region.
Design a dashboard that allows for an interactive and insightful exploration of the data, enabling users to view sales and profitability by state and region.

<h4>3.3 Dashboard Publication:</h4>
Publish the dashboard on a suitable platform, making it accessible to relevant stakeholders, such as executives and decision-makers in the financial products sector.

<h2>4 Business Insights:</h2>
Upon analyzing the data and the dashboard, the following business insights are derived:

<h4>4.1 The primary state in terms of sales in Brazil is in the Southeast:</h4>

<h4>4.2 The Southeast region has the highest sales volume, but the relative profit margin is not significant:</h4>
Although the Southeast region generates the most sales, the relative profitability, in comparison to other regions, is not significantly higher.

<h2>5. Conclusion:</h2>
In conclusion, this data visualization project provides a comprehensive overview of sales and profit by state and region in the financial products sector. While the Southeast region leads in sales, the actual profitability may not align with the sales figures. This project aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making in the financial industry by providing insights into the most and least profitable states and regions in Brazil. Further analysis and actions can be taken based on the insights gained from this dashboard.
